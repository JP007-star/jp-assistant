## Architecture

### Modular Design
- **SpeechEngine**: Handles all speech I/O operations
- **CommandProcessor**: Processes and routes commands
- **SystemManager**: System information and operations
- **MemoryManager**: Memory storage and retrieval
- **ProgramLauncher**: External program management

### Configuration
All settings are centralized in `config.py`:
- Audio settings (microphone, timeouts)
- TTS configuration
- System limits and thresholds
- Help text and error messages

## Customization

### Adding New Commands
1. Edit `command_processor.py`
2. Add new conditions in `process_command()` method
3. Implement the command logic

### Changing Voice Settings
1. Edit `config.py`
2. Modify `TTS_RATE`, `TTS_VOLUME`
3. Adjust microphone settings

### Adding New Programs
1. Edit `system_manager.py`
2. Add entries to `ProgramLauncher.PROGRAMS`

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Issues
- Check microphone permissions in Windows
- Try different microphone indices in config
- Ensure microphone is not used by other applications

### Speech Recognition Issues
- Check internet connection (Google Speech API)
- Speak clearly and avoid background noise
- Adjust timeout settings in config

### TTS Issues
- Install additional voice packages if needed
- Check system audio settings
- Try different voice selections

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Windows 10/11 (tested)
- Microphone access
- Internet connection (for Google Speech Recognition)
